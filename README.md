# spacemacs.d

My [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) configuration. Contains some useful custom functions (this being Emacs, just like everyone else's).

Any contributions from the internet are attributed in source code comments (in `init.el`), as appropriate. All original content in this repository is published under [The Unlicense](LICENSE.md).

Potentially useful notes below.


## Customizations

 - **Usability, general**:
   - Use the Zenburn color theme, easy on the eyes with good highlight colors. See the [theme gallery](https://themegallery.robdor.com/) or [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/robmerrell/spacemacs_theme_gallery).
   - Quick file switching in current window with `C-<next>`, `C-<prior>`. Skips any non-file buffers and knows when no files are open, or when the current buffer is the only file open. For the purposes of the switcher, Spacemacs's `untitled` buffers count as files.
     - Mainly more convenient than `M-m b n`, `M-m b p`, by having an easily repeatable key combo, and skipping buffers that are often uninteresting.
   - In `text-mode`, auto-complete from any text in any open buffer. We configure `company` to use `dabbrev` via a mode hook.
   - Spellcheck with [Enchant](https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant), allows proper spellchecking of both English and Finnish. Pre-configured for these two languages. (Requires a suitable Enchant and backends, see below for details.)
   - Bump `undo-limit` to a modern-day useful value ([see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/90si1c/why_cant_i_have_truly_persistent_undo_on_emacs/)). Helps with *oops, I just deleted the whole document* edits with large files such as source code.
   - Bookmark tweaks. Use [`bookmarkplus`](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookmarkPlus), and:
     - Adjust autoname format to `file.py:301,12:dostuff`, see `my-auto-l+c-name`. The function name part is omitted when `(which-function)` fails or returns nil.
     - Make autonamed bookmarks persist across sessions.
     - Tweak the visual style of all bookmarks to a non-intrusive blue (`SteelBlue4`). The fringe indicator goes on the **left for autonamed** bookmarks, and on the **right for manually named** bookmarks. 
   - Enable 1-based column indexing. Rows already are, so why not columns too?
   - Diminish some more minor mode lighters to de-clutter the modeline.
   - Minimap mode (bound to `<f9>`), provided by `sublimity`.
   - Several small things such as a single-key typo zapper (`<f8>` for `flyspell-correct-at-point`), and an `unfill-paragraph` function (`M-S-q`, [thanks to Stefan Monnier](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UnfillParagraph)).
 - **Cursor handling**:
   - *[Vim scrolloff](https://wolfecub.github.io/dotfiles/)*: cursor always tries to stay at least 10 lines from the upper/lower edge.
   - [`beacon`](https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon) to never visually lose the cursor when scrolling or switching buffers.
   - [`mwim`](https://github.com/alezost/mwim.el) for smart home/end keys.
   - [`multiple-cursors`](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el), with [`phi-search`](https://github.com/zk-phi/phi-search) incremental search. Uses the Spacemacs layer, with the `mc` backend.
 - **Usability, programming**:
   - `auto-highlight-symbol-mode` and `which-function-mode` enabled by default.
   - `python-mode`: enable `flycheck`, set up `company` for auto-completion. (Requires at least `flake8` and `jedi` from `pip`.)
   - `python-mode`: syntax highlighting for [MacroPy](https://github.com/azazel75/macropy) and [unpythonic](https://github.com/Technologicat/unpythonic).
   - Lisp eval minibuffer (`M-:`): enable `eldoc-mode`, `paredit-mode` and `smartparens-mode`.
   - Enable `prettify-symbols-mode` for an experimental code-readability improvement, with a generic setup and a Python-specific setup.
 - **Miscellaneous**:
   - Make tab completion work in Helm when Treemacs is open ([thanks to Simon Bourne](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/7446#issuecomment-417334718)).
   - New command `M-x select-all` that does exactly as it says on the tin. One-command alternative to `C-<end> C-SPC C-<home>`.
   - Finnish national holidays for the Emacs calendar (via package [`suomalainen-kalenteri`](https://github.com/tlikonen/suomalainen-kalenteri)). Highlight holidays by default.
   - Enable `pdf` layer for viewing **and annotating** PDFs in Emacs.

Note you'll need the *Source Code Variable* font from [here](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro).


## Custom key bindings

Most (but not all) of these are added by a global custom minor mode `custom-keys-minor-mode`, which is enabled by default.

This `init.el` is focused on the `emacs` editing mode (`holy-mode`) of Spacemacs. Hence `M-m` instead of `SPC` as the leader key in the relevant key bindings.

Key | Command
:--- |:---
`C-x` | cut (via `cua-mode`)
`C-c` | copy (via `cua-mode`)
`C-v` | paste (via `cua-mode`)
`C-z` | `undo-tree-undo`
`C-S-z` | `undo-tree-redo`
`M-z` | `helm-select-action`, to unshadow it since `C-z` is taken by undo
`C-s` | `phi-search` (supports `multiple-cursors`)
`C-r` | `phi-search-backward` (supports `multiple-cursors`)
`C-S-c` | copy full path of current buffer (if file)
`C-S-d` | copy full path of current directory (if file buffer)
`C-u C-S-d` | copy full path of project root (if in project)
`C-S-e` | open file manager in current directory (if file buffer)
`C-u C-S-e` | open file manager in project root (if in project)
`C-S-t` | open dedicated terminal in current directory, see var `dedicated-terminal-command-template`
`C-u C-S-t` | open dedicated terminal in project root
`C-t` | `spacemacs/shell-pop-inferior-shell`
`C-c e` | eval and replace sexp under point (simple Lisp calculator), the sexp goes to the kill ring
`C-<next>` | next file buffer (in current window)
`C-<prior>` | previous file buffer (in current window)
`M-S-q` | unfill paragraph, the counterpart of `fill-paragraph`
`<f7>` | `org-agenda`
`<f8>` | `flyspell-correct-at-point`, instant typo zapper (same as `M-s S s`)
`<f9>` | toggle minimap (provided by `sublimity`)
`<f12>` | toggle folding of current element (`yafolding`)
`S-<f12>` | go to parent element (`yafolding`)
`C-x 8 l` | insert `Î»`
`M-m s M` | `helm-multi-swoop` buffers that have the same major mode as the current one
`M-m s C-p` | `helm-multi-swoop-projectile` 
`M-m m O` (LaTeX mode) | `reftex-toc` (same binding for TOC as in Spacemacs `pdf` layer)
`RET` (calendar mode) | insert date under point in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

Note as usual in CUA mode, `C-x`, `C-c` still act as prefixes if no region is active - or if pressed quickly twice in succession (e.g. `C-x C-x`).

The `custom-keys-minor-mode` (while enabled) unmaps `C-z` from `evil-emacs-state-map`, because emulation maps precede minor mode maps and we want `C-z` for undo.

Note the function keys `<f10>` (menu) and `<f11>` (toggle frame full screen) are already taken.

The `<f10>` menu is missing many useful commands and includes many useless ones. Instead, in Spacemacs, for discovery use `M-m` (Spacemacs menu), `M-x` (Helm M-x), `M-m h d a` (Helm apropos).

We use `sublimity` as the minimap provider, because it works also in LaTeX mode, whereas the `minimap` package does not seem to want to co-operate with it. Upon first activation (globally per session), `sublimity` requires moving the cursor before the minimap actually appears (or alternatively, press `<f9>` three times at the first use during the session to force it to appear immediately). Upon second and further activations, the minimap appears immediately.

If you want to use `minimap` instead, be sure to [get it from GitHub](https://github.com/dengste/minimap); the version on ELPA seems to be old even though it has the same version number. As of this writing, only the version on GitHub has the ability to change the color of the highlighted line.

We use `yafolding` instead of the folding features of `evil`, because it requires no configuration, works perfectly for Python, and importantly, *draws nice-looking folding markers at the fringe*. Spacemacs's `evil` folding (required for languages not based on indentation) of course remains available.


## Some useful standard key bindings

These should be standard-ish Emacs.

Key | Command
:--- |:---
`C-g` | "quit", i.e. cancel the current command or ask Emacs to stop whatever it is currently doing.
`<f1>` | `help-command`, same as `C-h`
`<f1> k` | "what does the following key combo do?"
`<f1> f` | "what is the Lisp function under point?"
`<f1> v` | "what is the Lisp variable under point?"
`<f1> l` | `view-lossage` i.e. "what did I just press?"
`C-u C-x =` | `what-cursor-position` i.e. "what is the character under cursor?". Without the `C-u` gives just the number, with `C-u` also the name along with other info. Spacemacs has this as `M-m h d c`.
`<f3>` | start recording keyboard macro
`<f4>` | stop recording; replay last recorded keyboard macro (if not recording)
`C-x` | prefix: global commands
`C-x z` | repeat last command (that was not caused by an input event), hit more `z` to keep repeating
`C-c` | prefix: major-mode specific commands (Spacemacs has also `M-m m`, which is different)
`ESC` | *meta*; same as holding Alt (e.g. `ESC d` is `M-d`), but in Spacemacs allows discovery of `M-something` key bindings
`C-s` | isearch forward (see also `helm-swoop`)
`C-r` | isearch backward (see also `helm-swoop`)
`M-g M-g` | goto line (also `M-g g`, so doesn't matter whether Alt is held down or not)
`C-u M-g M-g` | goto line in most recently used other buffer (sometimes useful with a stack trace in an inferior shell)
`C-SPC` | (via `cua-mode`) set/unset mark, useful to select stuff without holding down shift
`C-u C-SPC` | (via `cua-mode`) jump to previous location of mark (so `C-SPC C-SPC` to tag a location without leaving mark active, and then later `C-u C-SPC` to jump back to it; consider also using bookmarks)
`M-s h` | set/remove visual highlighting (persists for the session until manually removed)
`M-s h .` | highlight symbol under point
`M-s h p` | highlight phrase (will ask for phrase and color)
`M-s h u` | remove highlighting (will ask which)
`C-x p` | `bookmarkplus` menu ("pookmarks"? `C-x b` is taken for buffer switching...)
`C-x p RET` | toggle autonamed bookmark at point
`C-x p n` | jump to next bookmark in current buffer (wraps around)
`C-x p p` | jump to previous bookmark in current buffer (wraps around)
`C-x p e` | edit/view all bookmarks (`RET` to jump, `x` to delete, `s u` to sort by url, `s f n` to sort by file name; see `?` for more key bindings)
`C-x p c m` | create named bookmark at point
`C-x p d` | delete bookmark by name
`C-x 8` | input some special chars, `RET` for insert by name (see also `M-x counsel-unicode-char`)
`C-x 0` | kill current window
`C-x 4 0` | kill current window **and buffer**
`M-l` | `downcase-word`, make word all-lowercase (starting at point; if at whitespace, apply to next word)
`M-c` | `capitalize-word`, make word have one uppercase letter (at point; if at whitespace, apply to next word)
`M-u` | `upcase-word`, make word all-uppercase (starting at point; if at whitespace, apply to next word)
`C-x C-x` | `exchange-point-and-mark` (e.g. jump cursor to other end of selected region, but preserve selection). When using `cua-mode`, if a region is selected, must use a quick `C-x C-x` and then another `C-x`, otherwise the first `C-x` will cut instead!
`C-c C-s i` | `synosaurus-choose-and-insert` ([thesaurus minor mode](https://github.com/hpdeifel/synosaurus) using [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) for English (`sudo apt install wordnet`))
`C-c C-s l` | `synosaurus-lookup`
`C-c C-s r` | `synosaurus-choose-and-replace`
`l` | (help viewer) back to previous viewed help page
`r` | (help viewer) forward (in the sense of opposite of back)
`q` | (help viewer, many others) quit, usually kills the window too
`M-<` | jump to beginning
`M->` | jump to end
`M-.` | (prog-mode) push marker, jump to definition of symbol under point 
`M-,` | (prog-mode) jump back by popping marker
`S` | (flycheck error list) sort by column under point (if possible)
`h` | (calendar-mode) show holidays for date under point
`a` | (calendar-mode) list holidays for current three months 
`S` | (calendar-mode) show sunrise, sunset, daylight length for date under point (if location configured; see `calendar-latitude`, `calendar-longitude`, `calendar-location-name`)
`M` | (calendar-mode) list moon phases for current three months

Function keys: by default, `<f2>` is used for 2C two-column mode, which doesn't play well with Spacemacs. Keys `<f5>`...`<f9>` and `<f12>` are unused. (We use some of them, see *Custom key bindings* above.)

Essentially, `<f3>` and `<f4>` together provide the same functionality as vim's `.`.

The `M-<` and `M->` keys are useful in contexts where the `home` and `end` keys are reserved for other purposes. For example, in a Helm session, `home` and `end` move the cursor in the text entry field, whereas `M-<` and `M->` jump to the beginning/end of the list of completion suggestions. The `M-<` and `M->` key bindings are also hard-coded into some modes such as the help viewer, and always guaranteed to work.

To debug a frozen Emacs (and potentially save your work), when `C-g` does not help, try `killall -s USR2 emacs` in a terminal. This will essentially `M-x toggle-debug-on-quit`.

Beside short cursor hops by nearby content, isearch is useful also in keyboard macros, e.g. to jump to a delimiter (usually on the same line). For actual search, see `helm-swoop`.


## Some useful Spacemacs key bindings

Key | Command
:--- |:---
`M-m` | Spacemacs menu
`M-m m` | major-mode specific Spacemacs menu (different from prefix `C-c`)
`M-m h d a` | `helm-apropos`, search Emacs documentation
`M-m h d f` | ...for Lisp functions only
`M-m h d v` | ...for Lisp variables only
`M-m b N n` | new file (create empty buffer and switch to it)
`M-m f s` | save (at first save of an unsaved buffer, will ask for destination)
`M-m q q` | quit Emacs (will ask to save modified buffers; to cancel quitting, use `C-g`)
`M-m q Q` | quit Emacs (just do it)
`M-m q f` | quit Emacs (kill current frame, but leave Emacs open in the background)
`M-m f f` | open file
`M-m f r` | open recent file
`M-m b b` | show currently open buffers
`M-m p p` | switch to (another) recent project
`M-m p f` | open file from current project
`M-m b R` | revert current file from disk
`M-m f R` | rename current file on disk
`M-m f c` | copy current file (will ask for destination)
`M-m w 2` | 2-column window layout (Spacemacs compatible)
`M-m w d` | kill current window (same as `C-x 0`)
`M-m w m` | maximize, i.e. kill other windows
`M-0` | open/focus Treemacs (use `M-0 q` to hide it)
`M-1` | focus window 1 (other numbers available, too)
`M-m j j` | avy timer, jump to a fragment of text on screen (type in a few letters or a word quickly, then wait and pick the occurrence to jump to)
`M-m v` | `expand-region`, select word/sentence/paragraph, sexp, string, ...
`M-m n` | narrowing, restrict view to current function et al. (to operate on it as if it was the whole document)
`M-m n r` | `narrow-to-region`
`M-m n w` | `widen`, i.e. exit from narrowing
`M-m g s` | open magit, the full-featured git control panel (see its `?`)
`M-m a u` | open the undo-tree viewer (see its `?` for key bindings), same as `C-x u`
`M-m e L` | open and jump to `flycheck` error list for current file
`M-m s s` | `helm-swoop`, an isearch with preview (up/down to pick, `RET` to jump, `C-g` to cancel; see also other swoop variants in the `M-m s` menu)
`M-m r l` | resume Helm session (e.g. continue a `helm-swoop` search that was exited via `RET`)
`M-m r y` | show kill ring (`RET` to paste an entry, `C-g` to cancel)
`M-m S` | spellchecking menu
`M-m S .` | spellchecking transient state
`M-m S d` | dictionary, i.e. switch to another language
`M-m S b` | spellcheck whole buffer
`M-m z f` | zoom frame transient state
`M-m s m` | `multiple-cursors` menu (once in `multiple-cursors-mode`, use `RET` to exit it; use `C-m` to insert a literal RET at each cursor)
`M-m s m a` | `mc/mark-all-dwim` (useful with `narrow-to-region`)
`M-m s m r` | `mc/edit-lines` (be careful what exactly is selected and where exactly point is before you invoke this!)
`M-m s m s n` | insert a running number at cursors (starting from 0)
`C-u 1 M-m s m s n` | insert a running number at cursors, starting from 1 (use a numeric prefix argument)
`M-m b w` | toggle buffer read-only
`M-m b w` (dired-mode) | make Dired listing writable (`C-c C-c` commit changes; `C-c C-k` cancel), e.g. for easy mass rename using the full power of Emacs

Note in [`projectile`](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), a project is [any directory that is under version control](https://jaketrent.com/post/projects-in-spacemacs/), so you don't have to do anything extra to create or manage a project. However, [Treemacs](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs) has its own idea of projects, which are essentially directories registered manually; see its `?` for key bindings.


## Notes on Org-mode

So far mostly for managing TODO lists.

Key | Command
:--- |:---
`TAB` | cycle folding for current subtree
`S-TAB` | cycle folding for whole buffer (also `C-u TAB`)
`C-c C-f` | jump to next heading at same level
`C-c C-b` | jump to previous heading at same level
`C-c C-u` | jump up one level
`C-c C-t` | cycle entry state TODO/DONE/none (also `S-<right>`, `S-<left>`)
`S-<up>`, `S-<down>` | cycle entry priority #A/#B/#C/none
`M-<up>`, `M-<down>` | move entry up/down
`M-<left>`, `M-<right>` | indent/outdent entry (in empty entry, can also use `TAB` to cycle level)
`M-RET` | insert blank heading at same level
`M-S-RET` | insert TODO heading at same level
`C-c C-s` | schedule entry (so it shows up as scheduled in the agenda)
`C-u C-c C-s` | unschedule entry
`C-c C-o` | `org-open-at-point`, open thing (such as link) in current entry (will prompt if several exist)

Use `M-x org-sort` with point on a parent entry to move DONE children to end (choose `o` for todo **o**rder).

Syntax for pretty links is `[[target][description]]`. To edit a pretty link, move to its end, and backspace to remove the last bracket.

See also `org-store-link` and `C-c C-l` (`org-insert-link`) to save bookmarks to file locations into the org file.

Shift selection not available by default, use `C-SPC` (set mark) to select a region.

For scheduling, repeater syntax is like `+1h`, `+1d`, `+1w`, `+1m`, `+1y`, such as `<2019-06-24 Mon +1w>`. Also `++` and `.+`. See [here](https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html).

See [Org tutorial](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.html) and [Org manual](https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html) for more.


## Some useful M-x commands

 - `replace-string`, `replace-regexp`
 - `count-words`
 - `calendar`
 - `link-hint-open-link-at-point`
 - `helm-for-files` find a file ([see e.g. this](http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/find-and-open-files-from-anywhere-with-helm-for-files/))
 - `counsel-unicode-char` pick and insert unicode char by name, with preview
 - `list-colors-display` pick and insert color, with preview
 - `kmacro-name-last-macro`, `insert-kbd-macro` to save keyboard macros
 - `artist-mode` draw rectangles and similar
 - `customize-group` configure stuff (a.k.a. Customize; some packages prefer to use this)
 - `org-agenda` agenda overview
 - `org-todo-list` overview of TODOs, once `org-agenda-files` is configured (`RET` to jump, `t` to cycle TODO/DONE/none, `s` to save all org buffers, `q` to quit)


## Fast Emacs startup

Use daemon mode. Save [this handy script](https://medium.com/@bobbypriambodo/blazingly-fast-spacemacs-with-persistent-server-92260f2118b7) as `~/.local/bin/em`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# https://medium.com/@bobbypriambodo/blazingly-fast-spacemacs-with-persistent-server-92260f2118b7
# https://superuser.com/questions/142945/bash-command-to-focus-a-specific-window

# Check if there's an Emacs frame open
emacsclient -n -e "(if (> (length (frame-list)) 1) 't)" 2> /dev/null | grep t &> /dev/null

if [ "$?" -eq "1" ]; then
    emacsclient -a '' -nqc "$@" &> /dev/null
else
    emacsclient -nq "$@" &> /dev/null
fi

# Focus the Emacs window
wmctrl -a emacs
```

and then set up your start menu shortcut (if you use one) to invoke that instead of `emacs` directly.

When using this, use `M-m q f` to quit Emacs so that it stays running in the background; `em` will connect to the running instance, if there is one.


## Configuring flake8

For static analysis of Python. [The default location](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html) (as far as `flake8` itself is concerned) for the configuration is `~/.config/flake8`. Note no `rc` at the end of the name, and that is a filename, not a directory.

However, Emacs thinks the default location is `~/.config/flake8rc` (note the `rc`), so if you want `flycheck-verify-setup` (`M-m e v`) to see it, the value must be customized (via `M-x customize-group flycheck-executables`). (This is already done in the `init.el` provided here.)

This gives [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)-like notes in the fringe for statically detected errors and style issues. My flake8 config:

```INI
[flake8]
# ignore silly style items
ignore =
    # overhanging indent
    E126,
    # continuation line over-indented for visual indent
    E127,
    # block comment should start with #
    E265,
    # expected 1 blank line, found 0
    E301,
    # expected 2 blank lines before def
    E302,
    # expected 2 blank lines after def
    E305,
    # expected blank line before nested def
    E306,
    # line too long >79 chars
    E501
exclude = .git,__pycache__,docs/source/conf.py,old,build,dist,node_modules,instance,00_stuff,00_old
```


## Emacs, flyspell, English and Finnish

The only free spellchecker that works properly with Finnish, [Voikko](https://voikko.puimula.org/), runs on the [enchant](https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant) meta-spellchecker framework. Voikko does come with an `ispell` emulation layer called `tmispell` (Ubuntu package `tmispell-voikko`), but this is deprecated. To run Voikko in a multilingual environment with multiple different spellchecking engines, `enchant` is the currently recommended (and only) option.

The Debian and Ubuntu packages of `enchant` are currently (2019/06) [eight years out of date](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/enchant/+bug/1830336). In the old version (1.6.0), personal dictionary saving does not work.

**Use Enchant 2.2.4 or later.** Recent versions up to 2.2.3 have a [bug](https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant/issues/212) in the [tokenize_line](https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant/blob/master/src/enchant.c) function which will silently truncate any `Ã¤` or `Ã¶` at the end of a word (before sending the input to Voikko for actual spellchecking).

Enchant almost works with Emacs's `ispell.el`. However, `enchant` takes `hunspell`-style *locale names* (`-d fi_FI`) for choosing the dictionary, instead of `ispell`-style language names (`-d finnish`). Hence, **out-of-the-box it will only work with the default dictionary** (which requires no `-d` option). Without further configuration, when `flyspell-mode` is enabled, and `enchant` is set up as the `Ispell program`, trying to switch to a non-default dictionary (`M-m S d` in Spacemacs) causes Emacs to freeze. (`C-g` to `Quit` or `killall -s USR2 emacs` to invoke the Elisp debugger (see [here](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/506/debugging-a-frozen-emacs)) will temporarily help, but the freeze will occur again.)

To use non-default dictionaries, put this in your `dotspacemacs/user-config` (in `.spacemacs.d/init.el`):

```elisp
  (setq ispell-local-dictionary "english")
  (setq ispell-local-dictionary-alist
        '(("english" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "en_US") nil utf-8)  ; "English" is en_US
          ("american" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "en_US") nil utf-8)
          ("british" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "[']" nil ("-d" "en_UK") nil utf-8)
          ("finnish" "[[:alpha:]]" "[^[:alpha:]]" "['-]" t ("-d" "fi") nil utf-8)))
  (setq ispell-program-name "~/.local/bin/enchant")
```

(This is already included in the `init.el` provided in this repository.)

Add more languages if needed. Important parts are the `-d lang_VARIANT` and the `utf-8`. Emacs is overly conservative here - the default settings still assume iso-8859-1, which will break the handling of `Ã¤` and `Ã¶` in any 21st century setup where everything is utf-8.

**Full instructions** for Enchant + Voikko + Emacs, roughly:

 - To spellcheck Finnish, install Voikko.
   - In Debian-based distros, Voikko should be in the default repository, so just `sudo apt install` it. The packages needed are `libvoikko1`, `voikko-fi`.
 - To spellcheck languages other than Finnish, install Aspell and/or Hunspell and the relevant dictionaries, as desired. See e.g. `apt search hunspell`.
 - Before building Enchant, make sure you have installed the prerequisites. On Debian-based distros, this means `sudo apt install` at least `build-essentials` and `libaspell-dev`, `libhunspell-dev`, `libenchant-voikko`, `libvoikko-dev`.
   - If Enchant's `configure` complains or something looks not quite right, add more packages as needed, and then re-run the `configure` step.
 - Get the [Enchant](https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant) source code, release 2.2.4 or later.
   - If you prefer to build from git instead, install also GNU autotools. Start the build by running `./bootstrap` to generate the `configure` script. If you're new to autotools, see [the manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html), esp. [section 2](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#Autotools-Introduction), for the concepts and an overview.
 - Build and install Enchant. The build process is a rather standard `./configure`, `make`, `make install`. [LfS has some instructions](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/enchant.html) just in case.
   - The goal is to get a config that supports Voikko for Finnish, and some other spellchecker(s) for other languages.
 - In the `configure` step, use `./configure --prefix=/home/myusername/.local --disable-static --enable-relocatable` or some such to get an installation that won't conflict with anything installed from the distro's package manager.
   - This assumes you *have* a `~/.local/bin` directory, and that it's in your `PATH`. See your `~/.bashrc`, which may need something like `export PATH=/home/myusername/.local/bin:$PATH`
 - Make the above customization to your `.spacemacs.d/init.el`.
 - `M-x customize-group RET ispell RET`. Find the setting for `Ispell program` and change it to `~/.local/bin/enchant`. Set and save for future sessions (option `1`).

You should now have a multilingual Enchant with support for both English and Finnish, configured to work with Emacs.

Once Enchant is installed, to see what backends it has, `enchant-lsmod` in the terminal. You can also query the backend used for an individual language by the locale name. E.g. `enchant-lsmod -lang en_US` will tell you which backend Enchant will use to check American English. If everything went smoothly, the output of `enchant-lsmod -lang fi_FI` should mention Voikko.

To test, restart Emacs, open a new buffer in text mode (Spacemacs: `M-m b N n`, `M-x text-mode RET`), type some English, and spellcheck the buffer (`M-m S b`). Then open another new buffer in text mode, write some Finnish, switch the dictionary to Finnish (`M-m S d fin RET`), and spellcheck the buffer. Be sure to test also with words that end with an `Ã¤` or `Ã¶`, such as `tÃ¤mÃ¤`, `hÃ¤iriÃ¶` and `tietyÃ¶`.

### Personal dictionary

 - **With Enchant 2.2.4**, saving new words to the personal dictionary with the `Save` option in `flyspell-correct-wrapper` (`M-m S c`) works for all languages.
   - The personal dictionary **does not work with Enchant 1.6.0** that is currently in Debian/Ubuntu repos.
 - Note in case of Finnish, **Enchant 2.2.4 is needed**. Enchant 2.2.3 will not work correctly; see [issue 212](https://github.com/AbiWord/enchant/issues/212), which was fixed in 2.2.4.

### Why is Finnish so hard to spellcheck?

Complex morphology. It's an [agglutinative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language) language. See [the classic example](https://satwcomic.com/aimlessly) (which Voikko clears without breaking a sweat). Also `tietokoneeseenikohan?` ("into my computer, I wonder?") is a valid construction - with a compound noun, and no less than *four* suffixes (-een: into, -ni: my, -ko: question, -han: I wonder).

This is why Aspell is simply not an option for Finnish. Even Hunspell only handles two suffixes. We really need Voikko and Enchant.
